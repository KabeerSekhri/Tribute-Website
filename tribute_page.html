        In 1985, Miura applied for entrance to the art college of Nihon
        University. He submitted a short project, Futatabi (再び, "Once More"),
        for examination and was granted admission. The project later earned him
        the 34th Newcomer Manga Award from Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Miura's next
        work, NOA, was published in Fresh Magazine in the same year, but it was
        not successful. In 1988, while working for Buronson on a project titled
        King of Wolves (王狼, Ōrō), Miura published a prototype of Berserk in
        Hakusensha's Monthly ComiComi; the 48-page prototype placed second in
        ComiComi's seventh Manga School competition. The full serialization of
        Berserk, which would become Miura's most famous and successful work,
        began in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House in 1989. In 1990, a sequel to
        King of Wolves, entitled Ōrō Den (王狼伝, "Legend of the King of
        Wolves"), was published in the same magazine. In 1992, Monthly Animal
        House was renamed Young Animal, where Berserk continued serialization.
        In the same year, Miura collaborated with Buronson on the manga Japan,
        which was also published in Young Animal. In 1997, Miura supervised the
        production of a 25-episode anime adaptation of Berserk produced by OLM,
        Inc., which aired in the same year on NTV. He also supervised the 1999
        Dreamcast video game Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage. In 2002, Miura
        received the Award for Excellence at the sixth Tezuka Osamu Cultural
        Prizes for Berserk. Starting in 2006, Berserk went on frequent and often
        extended hiatuses, and alternated between monthly and irregular
        serialization. By 2023, Berserk was collected into 42 tankōbon volumes
        in Japan, and by September 2023, it had over 60 million copies in
        circulation worldwide, including digital versions. The series also
        spawned a host of merchandise, both official and fan-made, ranging from
        statues, action figures to key rings, video games, and a trading card
        game. Various art books and supplemental materials by Miura based on
        Berserk were also released. In 2013, Miura released the short standalone
        manga Giganto Maxia, published in English-speaking territories by Dark
        Horse in 2016. Duranki, a short manga produced by Miura's personal manga
        studio Studio Gaga, was serialized in Young Animal Zero in 2019.

        Established as one of the best-selling manga of all time, Miura's series
        Berserk impacted the manga medium and beyond, with journalist Jade King
        stating: "[It] is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact his work
        has had on the world of games, manga, film, anime, and even literature."
        The image of Guts and his massive sword is attributed to inspiring
        characters like Cloud Strife of Final Fantasy VII and Dante from the
        Devil May Cry series, with the overall aesthetic of Berserk inspiring
        the monsters and world of the Dark Souls series.Video game director
        Hideaki Itsuno and producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi are fans of Berserk, and
        the role-playing hack and slash game Dragon's Dogma includes armor based
        on Guts and Griffith's. During a GDC talk in 2019, Itsuno stated that
        the tone and style of Devil May Cry 5 was inspired from Berserk.[31]
        Many authors have cited Miura and Berserk as influences, including Blue
        Exorcist author Kazue Kato, Baccano! and Durarara!! author Ryōgo Narita,
        Black Butler author Yana Toboso,[24] Black Clover author Yūki Tabata,
        and Attack on Titan author Hajime Isayama, who called it "tremendous,
        just magnificent [...] I got the impression that it was very well
        organized like a movie". Yoko Taro stated that the protagonist of
        Drakengard, Caim, was inspired by Berserk's protagonist Guts. A
        "memorial" Young Animal issue dedicated to Miura was released on
        September 10, 2021. Besides the inclusion of the posthumous chapter 364
        of Berserk, the issue featured a special "Messages to Kentarou Miura"
        booklet and a poster of "famous scenes" from the manga. In the issue,
        manga artist Kouji Mori, Miura's long-time friend, published a one-shot
        titled "Mori-chan Ken-chan", which tells the story of Mori's friendship
        with Miura.[39] On June 7, 2022, Hakusensha and Kouji Mori announced
        that Berserk would continue publication, using plans and thoughts that
        were relayed to Mori by Miura himself, as well as memorandums and
        character designs that Miura left behind. As the only person who knows
        the ending Miura intended, Mori agreed to continue the series and
        promised: "I will only write the episodes that Miura talked to me about.
        I will not flesh it out. I will not write episodes that I don't remember
        clearly. I will only write the lines and stories that Miura described to
        me."[40] The credits appear as "original work by Kentaro Miura, art by
        Studio Gaga, supervised by Kouji Mori".
